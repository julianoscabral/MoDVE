Modeling the Dynamics of Vascular Epiphytes

This is the repository with the codes and executables for a mechanistic simulation model for the spatiotemporal dynamics of vascular epiphytes (DFG project ModVE, number SA-21331). The model is presented in the PhD thesis of Gunnar Petter (https://ediss.uni-goettingen.de/handle/11858/00-1735-0000-0023-3E28-8) and in the manuscript:

Petter, G.; Zotz, G.; Kreft, H.; Sarmento Cabral, J. (2021). Agent-based modelling of the effects of forest dynamics, selective logging, and fragment size on epiphyte communities. Ecology and Evolution, early view. https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7255

*Disclaimer* The code and configuration files are not necessarily user friendly (no professional computer scientist here), so please do not hesitate in contacting if you want to apply the model and have trouble figuring out how to specify the configuration file.
